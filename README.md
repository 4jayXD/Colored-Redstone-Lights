Idk github that well but I've uploaded the source code for my mod "Better Redstone Lights" (https://modrinth.com/mod/better-redstone-lights).

I give full permission to use my code in a way that makes something new out of it. 
If you upload this unchanged, I WILL take it down. This is intended to help new developers (like me) learn the basics.
